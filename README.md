- Capsnet used on a more complex dataset than MNIST with RGB values.
- Max validation accuracy achieved was 65%.
- inspired by [This Repo](https://github.com/XifengGuo/CapsNet-Keras)

**TODO**
- Conduct experiments on other datasets. 
- Explore interesting characteristics of CapsuleNet.
- Improve the architecture for usage on datasets more complex than MNIST.
